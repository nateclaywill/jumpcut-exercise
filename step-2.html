						“Thank you Jesse and Kong, and also everybody else on the website. I initially started
						this website thinking will probably just check it out and end up taking jesse up on his
						offer and just use all the resources and then bail at 30 days and get a refund. Well, I
						am 100% NOT going to do that, cause I ACTUALLY learned so much from spam watching all
						the videos for 2 days. Especially since it had so much info. I was dying to get started
						so I did. Watching your tips and tricks made me hungry!!”

						“I just wanted to thank the guys at Jumpcut. Without their guidance I would have
						never been able to get my videos over 500 views. I uploaded a video of mine to a
						bunch of blogs one night and in the morning I started to get a bunch of subscribers.
						Turns out my video was trending on Total Frat Move's homepage! In 24 hours I got up
						to 41,000 views!!! Holy shit. This is just the beginning. Thank you so much guys.”

						videos mapped out... and plenty of ideas for more of the shit I'll be doing. ...
						Joining Jumpcut Academy has only fueled [my] motivation and made it CRAZY.”

						“Honestly it's only been about 48 hours since I joined Jumpcut Academy, but words
						can't explain the amount of new found value that's been added to my everyday life with

						just become an open book. Listen to each and every thing that everybody has to say.
						And that's how you'll make the best out of this program.”
